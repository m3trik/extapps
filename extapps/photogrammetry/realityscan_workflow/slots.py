"""Slots for the RealityCapture Workflow panel.

A thin :class:`extapps.photogrammetry._panel_slots.PhotogrammetryPanelSlots`
subclass sharing the photogrammetry-panel scaffolding with the Metashape panel
(Project-Name row, frames Source row via :class:`FramesSourceMixin`, run-mode
combo, semantic presets, header menu, async log-streaming ``b000``). It
**discovers the local RealityScan / RealityCapture install and drives the
headless pipeline** (:mod:`.run_combined`) through it via
:class:`._realityscan_runner.RealityScanRunner`.

Presets are engine-scoped (``presets/realityscan/``) and shared with the CLI: a
preset saved here is a RealityScan preset, picked up by ``run_combined --preset``
and never shown in another engine's list.
