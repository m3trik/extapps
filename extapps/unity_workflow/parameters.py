"""User-tunable parameters for the standalone Unity Workflow panel.

Only the **Unity-side** (copy-to-Assets + launch) knobs live here — the panel is
driven by an *already-exported* model file, so there are no DCC export params
(scope / triangulate / embed-textures) like the in-DCC ``unity_bridge`` has; the
host that exported the FBX owns those. Read by :class:`unitytk.CopyToAssetsDeliverer`
through :class:`unitytk.FileToUnityBridge`. Nothing is substituted into a template
(the deliverer copies the file), so the panel shows every param (no per-template
gating).

Mirrors the *Unity* section of :mod:`mayatk.env_utils.unity_bridge.parameters`
key-for-key so a preset/value reads the same in both panels.
