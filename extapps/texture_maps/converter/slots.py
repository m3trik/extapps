"""Map Converter UI — slot file for ``converter.ui``.

Bundles texture-map conversion, channel packing, PBR-workflow prep, and bulk
optimization into a single Switchboard panel. The heavy lifting lives in
``MapFactory`` / ``ImgUtils`` (in pythontk), and the converter's own batch rules
(destination / archive resolution, rename-mode naming, output collisions, the
dry-run report) in the Qt-free :class:`~extapps.texture_maps.converter._converter.MapConverter`,
which the slots class HOLDS as ``self.engine`` -- this module is the UI wiring only.

This module exposes :class:`ConverterSlots` — the Switchboard slot class.
Method names map to widget ``objectName`` in the .ui file: ``tb*`` =
toolbutton (has an options menu populated by the matching ``*_init`` hook),
``b*`` = plain button. Host integrations can inject a ``texture_provider``
callable to read the DCC selection.

The standalone launcher :class:`ConverterUI` lives in the sibling
:mod:`extapps.texture_maps.converter.launcher` module.
